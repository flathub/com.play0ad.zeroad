      The thirteen factions are: Three of the Hellenic States (Athens, Sparta and Macedonia), two of the kingdoms of Alexander the Great's successors (Seleucids and Ptolemaic Egyptians), two Celtic tribes (Britons and Gauls), the Romans, the Persians, the Iberians, the Carthaginians, the Mauryas and the Kushites.
    Each civilization is complete with substantially unique artwork, technologies and civilization bonuses.
